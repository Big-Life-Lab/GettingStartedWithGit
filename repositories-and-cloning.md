# Repositories and Cloning

Before you can start using various git features you have to first start or download a git project also called a **repository**. A git repository is just a folder on your computer that has git attached to it. There are 2 ways to create a git repository:

1. Downloading or **cloning** an existing repository
2. Starting your own repository

We will be focusing on the first way of starting a repository but if you are interested in number 2 these videos should help you:
