# Pull Requests

> Important Note: Pull Requests are not a git feature but a feature (if they decide to implement it) of your git cloud provider. For eg., Github which is our git cloud provider does support it.

Once your are done with your changes in a branch different from master, and are ready to merge those changes back into master, it is sometimes advantageous to get another person on your team or even yourself to review your changes to make sure everything looks right. This is where pull requests come in.

They allow you to assign members from your team who you would like to get feedback from, see exactly which files and the changes in each file that were made compared to the master branch and provide an interface where your reviewers can comment on your changes and suggest further changes.

The following resources should help you with this feature:
