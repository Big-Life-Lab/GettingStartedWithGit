# Adding, Staging and Commiting

A git commit is analogous to saving a file after you have made edits. In git, however, it is more than saving. Think of a commit like taking a photograph of the current state of your work and then writing a note on the photo of what has changed compared to your previous photo.

Before you commit your work, git requires you to **add** or **stage** all the files that go into the commit (the photo) into what it calls a **staging** area. This gives you more fine grained control at the file level to decide what goes into a commit. Going back to the photograph analogy, before actually taking the photo you decide and **add** all the items that will go into the photo into the **staging** area and then **commit** (click) the photo.

In this step you will create a commit that adds your name to the our-team.md file.

First modify the our-team.md file. This is a markdown file. Each section in a markdown file starts with a ## followed by the name of the section. Add your name to whatever section you feel you belong to by typing - followed by your name in a new line. Look at line 5 in the our-team.md file for an example.

Next follow the instructions here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YCO-3_MApI to commit your changes in Gitkracken. Note: in the video they say "to **stage** a file".

And you have sucessfully made your first ever commit!
