### Imputing missing data

Probably the biggest discussion is whether or not to perform data imputation (pros and cons). Once that decision has been made, most of us use multiple imputation using AregImpute (R) in Hmisc (Harrell F. , Package 'Hmisc', 2018) or similar approach.

That said, there are a few increadibly exhaustive summaries of different approaches in R.
